# Notes on preparing new data from Jim Harte for the Supplier Dash

# 2 forms needed:
# supplier.vec (list of all suppliers for current and previous year)
  #supplier.vec also should be alphabetized
# supplier data aggregated by month.  Also needs a Date.Sold field in it for exploratory.jh.time.series.R to work properly
